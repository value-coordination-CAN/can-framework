# Contributing to CAN

Thanks for your interest in contributing to the Contribution–Access Network (CAN).

## Ways to contribute
- Open an Issue for proposals, research questions, governance changes, or pilot ideas
- Improve documentation, diagrams, and examples
- Contribute code (backend reference implementation, simulations, SDKs)
- Contribute research (evaluation metrics, governance analysis, fairness audits)

## Workflow
1. Open an Issue describing the change
2. Fork the repo and create a branch: `feature/<name>` or `fix/<name>`
3. Implement changes with tests/docs as appropriate
4. Open a Pull Request and reference the Issue

## Standards
- Prefer clarity over jargon
- Keep claims testable and falsifiable
- Security-by-design and privacy-by-design principles apply to all contributions
