# CAN Governance Charter

## Maintainers
Initial steward: Alex Nikolov

## Decision Making
- Open proposals via GitHub Issues
- Public review period (14 days)
- Consensus where possible; otherwise majority decision by maintainers

## Forking Policy
Forks are encouraged for experimentation and localisation.

## Conflict Resolution
- Use GitHub Discussions first
- Escalate to a mediation panel selected by maintainers until elections exist
