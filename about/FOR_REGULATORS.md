# CAN — Quick Start for Regulators and Supervisory Authorities

## What CAN is (in regulatory terms)
CAN is a digital coordination layer for allocating access to shared resources using verified contribution, reliability, and care signals. It operates alongside monetary and fiscal systems and does **not** constitute a substitute for legal tender or a regulated payment instrument.

## Minimum oversight requirements
Before authorising a pilot, verify:
- lawful basis for data processing
- audit capability (technical + procedural)
- explainability where automation is used
- right to appeal and redress
- cybersecurity controls and incident reporting

## Sandbox approach
Recommended sequence:
1) regulatory sandbox approval
2) limited scope + population
3) continuous reporting
4) independent evaluation
5) exit/rollback procedures

## Interaction with CBDC and digital identity
Where integrated with CBDC platforms:
- separate payments from allocation decisions
- make conditional rules transparent and contestable
- prevent function creep via legal constraints and governance separation
