# Contribution–Access Network (CAN)
## Policy and Institutional Overview

### Purpose
CAN is a coordination framework designed to **complement** existing monetary, fiscal, and regulatory systems. It enables improved allocation of essential resources through verified **contribution**, behavioural **reliability**, and contextual **human needs**.

CAN is not intended to replace money. It provides a **parallel coordination layer** that strengthens social resilience and institutional legitimacy in digitally mediated economies — and acts as a bridge toward **direct value handling**.

---

### Why this matters now
Digitally mediated economies are increasingly shaped by AI, platforms, and network effects. Money remains essential, but it compresses multiple dimensions of reality into a single scalar price signal. This can reduce allocative accuracy in public services and can undermine legitimacy where citizens perceive market dynamics as misaligned with social needs.

CAN provides a structured way to recognise **direct value** (contribution), **operational trust** (reliability), and **human context** (care) as first-class signals in allocation decisions.

### Relationship to CBDC and Digital Public Infrastructure
CAN is designed to operate **on top of** CBDC and digital identity infrastructures.

CBDC platforms can provide:
- Secure settlement layers (where monetary settlement is appropriate)
- Identity verification hooks
- Auditability and policy-relevant observability
- Optional programmability under clear legal constraints

Within CAN, this infrastructure supports transparent access management, conditional service delivery, and accountable governance. CAN can therefore be a meaningful way to use CBDC infrastructure beyond payments — as a bridge toward regulated forms of **direct value handling**.

---

### Governance Model
CAN uses federated, transparent governance structures:
- Local/sectoral councils
- Rotating leadership
- Public audit trails
- Appeals and redress pathways
- Independent evaluation

No permanent central authority is embedded in the system design.

### Policy Applications (pilot-first)
- Social and affordable housing allocation
- Energy support schemes
- Public transport access
- Lifelong learning / reskilling
- Health and care coordination

---

### Risk management
- Algorithmic bias → independent audits, fairness testing, human oversight
- Data security → encryption, least privilege, incident reporting
- Elite capture → rotating governance, transparency, time-limited mandates
- Function creep → legal boundaries, separation of powers, data minimisation

---

### Evaluation framework (examples)
- Allocation accuracy and service targeting
- Equity and inclusion indicators
- Participation and retention rates
- Complaints/appeals resolution time
- Public trust and satisfaction measures
- System resilience metrics (uptime, stress tests)
