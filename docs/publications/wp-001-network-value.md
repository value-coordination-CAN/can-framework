## Abstract

This paper outlines how multi-tier social networks enable large-scale
coordination and direct value exchange without monetary mediation.

Building on six degrees of separation and network theory, it shows how
digital platforms transform social proximity into usable infrastructure
for trust, reputation, and resource allocation.

Within CAN, these networks become formal inputs for governance and access.

## Conclusion

CAN connects digital social infrastructure to physical and institutional life,
enabling scalable direct value handling through infrastructure rather than ideology.
