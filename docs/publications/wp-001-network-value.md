## Abstract

This paper outlines how multi-tier social networks enable large-scale
coordination and direct value exchange without monetary mediation.

Building on research into “six degrees of separation” and network theory,
it shows how digital platforms transform social proximity into usable
infrastructure for trust, reputation, and resource allocation.

Within CAN, these networks become formal inputs for governance and access.

## 1. Background: Six Degrees of Separation

In large human societies, almost everyone is connected through a small number
of social links.

This principle, known as **six degrees of separation**, was first demonstrated
experimentally by Stanley Milgram in the 1960s and later popularised in network
science research.

Digital platforms such as LinkedIn have operationalised this principle at
planetary scale, transforming social proximity into usable coordination
infrastructure.

## 2. From Social Proximity to Economic Coordination

Historically, direct coordination was limited to small communities.

Beyond that scale, trust collapsed.

Money emerged as a substitute for missing social information.

It allowed strangers to cooperate without knowing each other.

Digital networks now reconstruct that missing information.

They make visible:

- Who knows whom  
- Who has worked with whom  
- Who is trusted by whom  
- How reputations propagate  

Trust becomes navigable.

Money is no longer the only coordination mechanism.

## 3. Multi-Tier Networks and Transitive Trust

On platforms such as LinkedIn, relationships are organised into layers:

- First-degree → Direct trust  
- Second-degree → Mediated trust  
- Third-degree → Contextual trust  

Each layer adds validation.

If someone is trusted by people you trust, credibility compounds.

This is known as **transitive trust**.

It reflects Mark Granovetter’s research on the “strength of weak ties”, which
demonstrates that indirect connections often enable the most powerful
coordination.

Within CAN, this becomes distributed reputation.

---

## 4. Direct Value Exchange Without Money

Large volumes of value are already exchanged without payment:

- Knowledge sharing  
- Mentorship  
- Introductions  
- Collaboration  
- Strategic advice  
- Research cooperation  

These exchanges are mediated by relationship and reputation, not price.

Money may appear later.

Coordination happens first.

This constitutes direct value handling in practice.

---

## 5. Networks as Trust Infrastructure

Multi-tier networks function as living trust systems.

They continuously update information about:

- Competence  
- Reliability  
- Ethics  
- Collaboration  
- Risk  

This information is richer than financial credit scores and harder to manipulate.

Within CAN, network data becomes a formal governance input.

---

## 6. From Opportunity Exchange to Resource Exchange

Today, platforms regulate access to:

- Jobs  
- Contracts  
- Visibility  
- Influence  

CAN extends this logic to material resources:

- Housing  
- Workspaces  
- Energy  
- Education  
- Transport  
- Care services  

Allocation shifts from:

“How much can you pay?”

to:

“How are you connected, and how have you contributed?”

---

## 7. Six Degrees as a Value Transmission Layer

When social distance is small, networks become transmission layers for value.

Reputation travels. Contribution propagates. Support mobilises.

Under CAN:

Local action → Network validation → System-wide recognition

Value becomes mobile without becoming money.

## 8. Role of AI: Aggregating Distributed Judgement

Without AI, large-scale network coordination is too complex.

With AI, it becomes manageable.

AI enables:

- Network pattern analysis  
- Reputation verification  
- Fraud detection  
- Bias correction  
- Impact measurement  
- Multi-platform aggregation  

AI does not replace human judgement.

It synthesises it.

---

## 9. Integration Within CAN

Within CAN, multi-tier networks function as:

- Identity verification layers  
- Reputation validators  
- Anti-gaming mechanisms  
- Governance inputs  
- Conflict-resolution references  

They feed directly into:

Contribution + Reliability + Care → Access

No monetary proxy is required.

---

## 10. Structural Implications

Money exists because strangers lack information about each other.

Multi-tier networks reduce anonymity.

They turn strangers into “known unknowns”.

Over time, coordination shifts from:

Price → Relationship → Reputation → Contribution

This forms the basis of scalable post-monetary systems.

## Conclusion

The Contribution–Access Network connects digital social infrastructure to
physical and institutional life, enabling scalable direct value handling
through infrastructure rather than ideology.
