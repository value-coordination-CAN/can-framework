# Contribution–Access Network (CAN)
## WP-002: A Practical Post-Money System for Allocating Resources

**Working Paper WP-002**
**Status:** Practical Design Draft
**Version:** 1.1
**Date:** 2026

---

## Abstract

This paper specifies a realistic model for allocating resources without money
in large-scale, low-trust environments.

It is not utopian and not moralistic.

It is designed for real humans, including predictable human factors such as
emotion, laziness, ego, fear, burnout, and opportunism.

CAN replaces monetary purchase with a structured allocation rule based on
verified contribution, reliability, and care context.

## 1. Core Principle

**Access is earned through contribution, not bought with tokens.**

CAN does **not** use:

- Money inside the allocation layer
- Universal tradeable credits
- Accumulation by abstract purchasing power

CAN does use:

- Verified useful activity
- Reliability over time
- Human-need correction mechanisms

This principle already appears in partial form on platforms such as GitHub,
Stack Overflow, Wikipedia, open-source ecosystems, and status-based access
systems.

## 2. Three Ledgers (Not One)

Money collapses many value types into one number.

CAN separates allocation inputs into three ledgers.

### A. Contribution Ledger (What You Give)

Tracks useful outputs and inputs, including:

- Work and maintenance
- Care labour
- Teaching and mentoring
- Creativity and problem-solving

Validation uses peer confirmation plus observed downstream usage.

### B. Reliability Ledger (Can You Be Trusted?)

Tracks whether commitments are executed:

- Showing up
- Completing tasks
- Consistency over time
- Abuse or non-delivery patterns

This ledger supports planning and system-level predictability.

### C. Care Ledger (Human Need)

Tracks constraints and vulnerability that should adjust allocation:

- Illness
- Burnout
- Parenting and care load
- Age and crisis events

Purpose: prevent punishment for ordinary human life conditions.

## 3. Resource Pools (Not Markets)

Resources are organized into governed commons pools, for example:

- Housing
- Food
- Energy
- Transport
- Learning access
- Tools and workspaces

Users request access; they do not bid.

Allocation uses transparent weighting:

**Contribution + Reliability + Care → Access Priority**

Governance is local-first with digital coordination.

---

## 4. Operational Examples

### Housing

High contribution + high reliability + elevated family/health stress ⇒ higher
priority.

Outcome: fewer bidding wars and lower extraction pressure.

### Transport

Strong usage record ⇒ fast access.

Repeated misuse ⇒ restricted access.

Outcome: car-sharing style accountability at infrastructure scale.

### Food

Core baseline is guaranteed.

Additional options can be contribution-weighted.

Outcome: no starvation floor and no unlimited hoarding ceiling.

## 5. Motivation Without Money

CAN assumes humans are motivated by more than cash:

- Status
- Belonging
- Purpose
- Recognition
- Autonomy

The system makes these motivations visible and institutionally meaningful.

Social capital becomes actionable coordination capital.

## 6. Free-Riding, Laziness, and Participation Tiers

CAN assumes some people will try to minimize contribution.

It responds through tiered access (not punitive deprivation):

- **Core** → survival guarantees
- **Active** → stable comfort access
- **Builder** → expanded privileges
- **Steward** → governance influence

No starvation punishment.

No premium access for permanent free-riding.

Pressure is primarily social and structural rather than carceral.

---

## 7. Corruption and Capture Prevention

CAN includes explicit anti-capture safeguards:

- Decentralized governance cells
- Transparent, auditable records
- Rotating roles and term limits
- AI-assisted anomaly and collusion detection
- Community veto and contestability pathways

Design target: no durable elite lock-in.

---

## 8. Technical Feasibility

CAN requires no speculative breakthrough.

Necessary components already exist:

- Identity systems
- Distributed ledgers / append-only logs
- Reputation and trust scoring systems
- AI verification and auditing assistance
- Local governance applications

Current deployments are mainly finance-first; CAN repurposes these capabilities
for resource coordination.

---

## 9. Transition Path (No Sudden Switch)

CAN is designed for phased transition:

1. **Parallel Layer** — deploy in bounded pilots alongside money
2. **Pool Expansion** — add domains and participants
3. **Monetary Shrinkage** — reduce price mediation where CAN performs reliably
4. **Post-Money Majority** — money remains peripheral in many domains

Goal: transition without collapse dynamics and without revolutionary rupture.

---

## 10. Why It Works Psychologically

CAN maps common human frictions to explicit design responses:

- Laziness → tiered access boundaries
- Ego → visible status and contribution profiles
- Fear → guaranteed basics
- Greed → no universal accumulation vector
- Burnout → care-ledger protection

CAN is designed for flawed humans, not idealized actors.

---

## 11. Where It Already Exists (Partially)

CAN-like logic already appears in:

- Open-source communities
- Guild structures
- Cooperatives
- Mutual aid networks
- Community trusts

CAN integrates these fragments into shared public infrastructure.

---

## Strategic Insight

Money coordinates by proxy.

CAN coordinates by direct value recognition.

**Action → Impact → Access**

Post-money is not “no system.”

It is better trust and coordination infrastructure for networked societies.
