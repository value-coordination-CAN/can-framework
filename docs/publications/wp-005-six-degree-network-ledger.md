# WP-005: Six-Degree Network Ledger Architecture and Hybrid Non-Monetary Complex Settlement

## Abstract
Extends CAN into a graph-native coordination architecture supporting multi-degree contribution propagation, trust computation, and Non-Monetary Complex Settlement (NMCS).

## Core Model
G = (N, E, W)

N = Participants  
E = Enablement edges  
W = Time-sensitive trust and impact weights  

Graph settlement replaces scalar monetary exchange.

## Hybrid Transition
Monetary systems remain at compliance layer.
Graph settlement governs coordination layer.
Transition is evolutionary.
