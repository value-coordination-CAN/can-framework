## Abstract

This paper extends the Contribution–Access Network (CAN) framework into a fully graph-native coordination architecture capable of operating across multi-degree separation.

It formalises:

- Networked contribution propagation
- Multi-degree trust computation
- Explicit need–capacity discovery
- Non-Monetary Complex Settlement (NMCS)
- A hybrid bridge from monetary settlement to direct value handling

Where monetary systems collapse coordination into scalar exchange (“A pays B”), CAN replaces exchange settlement with graph settlement — dynamically updating access weights based on verified enablement across dependency chains.

This architecture enables large-scale coordination without tradable tokens, without price mediation as primary allocator, and without centralised clearing authorities.

## 1. Motivation

Modern production, knowledge creation, and care systems do not operate bilaterally. Outcomes are multi-hop.

Housing, software, research, food distribution, and infrastructure depend on extended enablement chains across numerous actors who may never directly transact.

Monetary settlement hides this structure behind price signals. CAN makes the structure explicit.

WP-005 introduces the six-degree network architecture required to coordinate such systems without collapsing them into financial transfers.

---

## 2. From Ledgers to Graph Systems

Earlier CAN specifications introduced three ledgers:

1. Contribution  
2. Reliability  
3. Care  

In WP-005 these evolve into a dynamic graph model.

Let:

**G = (N, E, W)**

Where:

- **N** = participants (nodes)  
- **E** = verified contribution or enablement edges  
- **W** = weighted, time-sensitive trust and impact metrics  

Allocation decisions derive from graph topology, not scalar balances.

---

## 3. Networked Contribution Ledger (NCL)

### 3.1 Multi-Degree Contribution

Each verified contribution creates:

- A node
- A directed enablement edge
- A weighted impact trace

Contribution recognition occurs at:

- Direct level (A → B)
- Indirect level (A → B → C → D)
- Systemic level (infrastructure contributions affecting unknown beneficiaries)

Impact weight decays over network distance unless reinforced through multi-path validation.

Contribution cannot be:

- Transferred
- Sold
- Abstracted into universal credit

It only influences access priority within governed resource pools.

---

## 4. Trust Propagation Ledger (TPL)

Trust is not binary.

Trust(A → Z) is computed via:

- Shortest validated paths
- Path redundancy
- Reliability history
- Governance cell validation
- Degree distance decay

Trust weakens across degrees unless reinforced through diverse validation paths.

Anti-capture safeguards include:

- Path diversity thresholds
- Reinforcement caps
- AI anomaly detection
- Random audit sampling
- Cross-cell arbitration

Trust must emerge from distributed validation, not clique amplification.

---

## 5. Need–Capacity Discovery Layer (NCDL)

Money hides demand behind price. CAN surfaces demand directly.

Each participant declares:

- Needs
- Verified constraints
- Available capacities
- Latent competencies

This forms a bipartite graph:

**Needs ↔ Capacities**

The coordination layer identifies:

- Direct matches
- Multi-hop chains
- Surplus pools
- Bottlenecks

Allocation becomes proactive routing rather than reactive bidding.

---

## 6. Complex Settlement Engine (CSE)

### 6.1 Multi-Hop Settlement

Monetary systems settle bilaterally. CAN settles graph-wide.

If Z receives housing enabled by A–F, the system:

- Maps the full dependency graph
- Assigns proportional enablement weight
- Updates contribution and reliability metrics
- Rebalances future access priority

No token circulates. The graph updates.

### 6.2 Reverse Propagation

If Z later contributes to infrastructure benefiting A–F, weights propagate backward through dependency paths.

Settlement becomes recursive network reinforcement. Not exchange closure.

---

## 7. Access Computation

Access priority for participant n:

**P(n) = f(**  
direct contribution,  
propagated contribution,  
trust centrality,  
reliability stability,  
verified need factor,  
governance constraints  
**)**

This is a computed vector within each resource pool. Not a stored balance.

---

## 8. Non-Monetary Complex Settlement (NMCS)

### 8.1 Definition

Non-Monetary Complex Settlement (NMCS) is:

Graph-based rebalancing of contribution and access weights across multi-hop dependency chains without the transfer of tradable tokens.

Settlement updates network structure rather than transferring currency.

### 8.2 Why This Matters

NMCS enables:

- Recognition of distributed enablement
- Multi-degree coordination
- Settlement without scalar exchange
- Large-scale non-monetary cooperation

---

## 9. Hybrid Transition Bridge

Immediate removal of money is impractical. NMCS enables coexistence.

**Layer 1 – Monetary Interface**
- Legal compliance
- Taxation
- External exchange

**Layer 2 – Graph Settlement (CAN)**
- Contribution weighting
- Trust propagation
- Access rebalancing

Money handles compliance. NMCS handles coordination.

Over time, monetary settlement becomes peripheral in domains where graph settlement proves more efficient. Transition is evolutionary, not abrupt.

## 10. Applied Illustration: Platform Mediation vs Graph Settlement

Consider the ecosystem of Google, which has distributed over USD 100 billion to creators over recent years via advertising revenue-sharing systems.

The structural topology:

- A → Z (Creators provide informational value for free)
- Z → Y (Users provide attention to advertisers)
- Y → B (Advertisers pay platform)
- B → A (Platform redistributes revenue)

Where:
- A = Content creators
- Z = Users
- Y = Advertisers
- B = Platform infrastructure

Creators provide knowledge to users for free. Users do not pay creators.

Monetisation occurs indirectly via advertising markets. The platform becomes central clearing authority.

The true value path (A → Z) is non-monetary. Settlement is displaced to advertising exchange.

Under NMCS:

- A → Z contribution would be directly recognised.
- Z engagement would reinforce contribution weights.
- Infrastructure contribution by B would be separately weighted.
- Revenue (if present in hybrid phase) would be treated as external input.

The graph would compute enablement across all degrees. No central redistribution monopoly would be required.

This example demonstrates:
- Multi-degree value propagation already exists.
- Monetary settlement overlays it.
- Infrastructure for graph tracking already operates at scale.

What changes under CAN is settlement logic.

## 11. Structural Implications

This architecture enables:

- Coordination without price as primary allocator
- Trust without central authority
- Settlement without tokens
- Explicit recognition of multi-degree enablement
- Gradual transition from monetary mediation to direct value handling

Where money asks:

“Who paid whom?”

CAN asks:

“Who enabled what — across how many degrees — and how should access adjust accordingly?”

---

## 12. Conclusion

WP-005 formalises the transition from ledger coordination to graph coordination.

By embedding six-degree propagation, need discovery, and Non-Monetary Complex Settlement into the core of CAN, this architecture:

- Preserves large-scale operability
- Reduces extraction pressure
- Enables hybrid transition
- Gradually renders monetary settlement structurally optional

This is not abolition by decree. It is replacement by functional superiority.

Graph settlement replaces exchange settlement. Direct value handling replaces price mediation. The coordination layer evolves.
