## 1. Introduction

The CAN Framework is not merely a conceptual architecture for value coordination.  
It is designed to operate within real-world technical, regulatory, and governance environments.

To achieve durability, interoperability, and global legitimacy, alignment with international and industry coordination bodies such as:

- International Telecommunication Union (ITU)  
- International Organization for Standardization (ISO)  
- European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI)  
- World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)  
- Bank for International Settlements (BIS)  
- GSMA  

is not optional for systemic interoperability — it is structural.

These institutions provide the frameworks through which technical architectures gain coherence, legitimacy, and long-term viability.

## 2. Why Standards Matter in Value Coordination

Value coordination systems involve:

- Identity  
- Trust frameworks  
- Financial interoperability  
- Secure communications  
- Data exchange  
- Governance models  
- Cross-border coordination  

Without standards alignment:

- Systems fragment  
- Interoperability weakens  
- Trust remains local rather than systemic  
- Regulatory friction increases  
- Long-term resilience is reduced  

Standards transform architectural concepts into interoperable infrastructure.

## 3. The Role of ITU

The ITU is a United Nations specialised agency coordinating global telecommunications infrastructure.

It:

- Develops international telecom standards  
- Facilitates consensus among governments and regulators  
- Supports cross-border digital infrastructure coordination  

For CAN, ITU alignment enables:

- Interoperable telecommunications foundations  
- Structured dialogue with sovereign authorities  
- Integration into national digital infrastructure strategies  

ITU provides the multilateral backbone for digital infrastructure coherence.

## 4. The Role of ISO

ISO develops voluntary international standards across sectors.

Its relevance includes:

- Information security  
- Governance and risk management  
- Quality and compliance frameworks  
- Cross-sector harmonisation  

ISO alignment allows CAN to:

- Embed recognised governance models  
- Ensure security maturity  
- Reduce institutional friction  
- Strengthen credibility in enterprise and governmental environments  

ISO provides operational legitimacy and structural durability.

## 5. The Role of ETSI

ETSI develops globally applicable standards closely integrated with European regulatory frameworks.

Its scope includes:

- Telecommunications  
- Cybersecurity  
- Digital identity and trust services  
- IoT systems  
- 5G and emerging network architectures  

ETSI enables CAN to:

- Align with EU digital identity initiatives  
- Integrate into trust-service ecosystems  
- Ensure cybersecurity compatibility  
- Bridge telecom infrastructure with value coordination systems  

ETSI represents regulatory-technical convergence in the European context.

## 6. The Role of W3C

W3C defines the foundational standards of the web.

Its work includes:

- Web architecture  
- Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)  
- Verifiable Credentials  
- Semantic interoperability  
- Privacy-preserving technologies  

For CAN, W3C alignment ensures:

- Web-native identity integration  
- Portable trust credentials  
- Open interoperability  
- Compatibility with decentralised coordination architectures  

W3C anchors distributed trust systems in open web standards.

## 7. The Role of BIS

BIS serves as a coordination platform for central banks and plays a significant role in:

- Financial stability frameworks  
- Cross-border payments  
- Central Bank Digital Currency research  
- Financial innovation infrastructure  

Although not a technical standards body in the same sense as ITU or ISO, BIS shapes:

- The evolution of digital monetary infrastructure  
- Institutional financial governance models  
- Systemic risk frameworks  

For CAN, awareness and alignment with BIS initiatives ensures:

- Compatibility with evolving monetary systems  
- Institutional dialogue rather than isolation  
- Structural awareness of global financial trajectories  

BIS represents the monetary coordination layer.

## 8. The Role of GSMA

GSMA represents mobile network operators worldwide and develops industry frameworks for:

- SIM and eSIM standards  
- Mobile identity  
- Secure authentication  
- 5G infrastructure  
- Mobile financial services  

GSMA enables CAN to:

- Integrate with mobile identity infrastructures  
- Leverage secure device-level trust anchors  
- Scale through telecom networks  
- Support inclusion in mobile-first economies  

GSMA provides the operational deployment layer of global digital infrastructure.

---

## 9. Institutional Convergence

Value coordination infrastructure sits at the intersection of:

- Telecommunications governance (ITU)  
- Security and cross-sector governance (ISO)  
- European regulatory-technical integration (ETSI)  
- Web-native interoperability (W3C)  
- Monetary coordination (BIS)  
- Mobile industry deployment (GSMA)  

Future value infrastructures will emerge from the convergence of these domains.

CAN recognises that structural transformation requires interaction between open innovation and institutional evolution.

## 10. Open Forum Principle and Voluntary Participation

The CAN Framework operates as an open coordination architecture.

Engagement with standards and institutional bodies is not compulsory for participation.

CAN does not require endorsement from any institution in order to function.

Participation remains voluntary and open.

However, institutional alignment is desirable because it:

- Enhances interoperability  
- Reduces fragmentation  
- Enables cross-border coordination  
- Improves governance compatibility  
- Strengthens long-term resilience  

CAN does not position itself as subordinate to institutional frameworks, nor as adversarial.

Structural transformation occurs through interaction between open architectures and institutional evolution.

Engagement is therefore not a condition of participation — but a pathway to systemic integration.
