+# Contribution–Access Network (CAN)
+## WP-005: Six-Degree Network Ledger Architecture and Hybrid Non-Monetary Complex Settlement
+
+**Working Paper WP-005**  
+**Status:** Publication Draft  
+**Version:** 1.0  
+**Date:** 2026  
+
+---
+
+## Abstract
+
+This paper extends the Contribution–Access Network (CAN) framework into a graph-native coordination architecture capable of operating across multi-degree separation.
+
+It formalises:
+
+- Networked contribution propagation
+- Multi-degree trust computation
+- Explicit need–capacity discovery
+- Non-Monetary Complex Settlement (NMCS)
+- A hybrid bridge from monetary settlement to direct value handling
+
+Where monetary systems collapse coordination into scalar exchange (“A pays B”), CAN replaces exchange settlement with graph settlement — dynamically updating access weights based on verified enablement across dependency chains.
+
+This architecture enables large-scale coordination without tradable tokens, without price mediation as primary allocator, and without centralised clearing authorities.
+
+---
+
+## 1. Motivation
+
+Modern production, knowledge creation, and care systems do not operate bilaterally.
+
+Outcomes are multi-hop.
+
+Housing, software, research, food distribution, education, and infrastructure depend on extended enablement chains across numerous actors who may never directly transact.
+
+Monetary settlement compresses these dependency graphs into scalar transfers. The complexity of enablement becomes invisible behind price signals.
+
+CAN makes this structure explicit.
+
+WP-005 introduces the six-degree network architecture required to coordinate multi-hop systems without collapsing them into financial exchange.
+
+---
+
+## 2. From Ledgers to Graph Systems
+
+Earlier CAN specifications introduced three ledgers:
+
+1. Contribution  
+2. Reliability  
+3. Care  
+
+In WP-005 these evolve into a dynamic graph architecture.
+
+Let:
+
+**G = (N, E, W)**
+
+Where:
+
+- **N** = participants (nodes)
+- **E** = verified contribution or enablement edges
+- **W** = weighted, time-sensitive trust and impact metrics
+
+Allocation decisions derive from graph topology rather than scalar balances.
+
+Settlement becomes structural rebalancing within the network.
+
+---
+
+## 3. Networked Contribution Ledger (NCL)
+
+### 3.1 Multi-Degree Contribution
+
+Each verified contribution generates:
+
+- A participant node
+- A directed enablement edge
+- A weighted impact trace
+
+Contribution recognition occurs at:
+
+- **Direct level** (A → B)
+- **Indirect level** (A → B → C → D)
+- **Systemic level** (infrastructure contributions affecting unknown beneficiaries)
+
+Impact weight decays over network distance unless reinforced through multi-path validation.
+
+Contribution cannot be:
+
+- Transferred
+- Sold
+- Abstracted into universal credit
+
+It influences only future access priority within governed resource pools.
+
+---
+
+## 4. Trust Propagation Ledger (TPL)
+
+Trust within CAN is neither binary nor centrally assigned.
+
+Trust(A → Z) is computed via:
+
+- Shortest validated paths
+- Path redundancy
+- Reliability history
+- Governance cell validation
+- Degree distance decay
+
+Trust weakens across degrees unless reinforced through diverse, independent validation paths.
+
+### 4.1 Anti-Capture Safeguards
+
+To prevent clique amplification and systemic manipulation, CAN incorporates:
+
+- Path diversity thresholds
+- Reinforcement caps
+- AI-assisted anomaly detection
+- Random audit sampling
+- Cross-cell arbitration
+
+Trust must emerge from distributed validation, not concentrated clusters.
+
+---
+
+## 5. Need–Capacity Discovery Layer (NCDL)
+
+Money obscures demand behind price.
+
+CAN surfaces demand directly.
+
+Each participant declares:
+
+- Needs
+- Verified constraints
+- Available capacities
+- Latent competencies
+
+This produces a dynamic bipartite graph:
+
+**Needs ↔ Capacities**
+
+The coordination layer identifies:
+
+- Direct matches
+- Multi-hop enablement chains
+- Surplus pools
+- Structural bottlenecks
+
+Allocation becomes proactive routing rather than reactive bidding.
+
+---
+
+## 6. Complex Settlement Engine (CSE)
+
+### 6.1 Multi-Hop Settlement
+
+Monetary systems settle bilaterally.
+
+CAN settles graph-wide.
+
+If Z receives housing enabled by actors A–F, the system:
+
+- Maps the full dependency graph
+- Assigns proportional enablement weight
+- Updates contribution and reliability metrics
+- Rebalances future access priority
+
+No token circulates.
+
+The graph updates.
+
+### 6.2 Reverse Propagation
+
+If Z later contributes to infrastructure benefiting A–F, weights propagate backward across dependency paths.
+
+Settlement becomes recursive network reinforcement — not exchange closure.
+
+---
+
+## 7. Access Computation
+
+Access priority for participant *n* within a given resource pool:
+
+**P(n) = f(**  
+direct contribution,  
+propagated contribution,  
+trust centrality,  
+reliability stability,  
+verified need factor,  
+governance constraints  
+**)**  
+
+This is a computed vector within each resource pool, not a stored balance.
+
+---
+
+## 8. Non-Monetary Complex Settlement (NMCS)
+
+### 8.1 Definition
+
+Non-Monetary Complex Settlement (NMCS) is:
+
+Graph-based rebalancing of contribution and access weights across multi-hop dependency chains without the transfer of tradable tokens.
+
+Settlement updates network structure rather than transferring currency.
+
+### 8.2 Why This Matters
+
+NMCS enables:
+
+- Recognition of distributed enablement
+- Multi-degree coordination
+- Settlement without scalar exchange
+- Large-scale non-monetary cooperation
+
+It replaces payment finality with structural equilibrium.
+
+---
+
+## 9. Hybrid Transition Bridge
+
+Immediate removal of money is neither practical nor stable.
+
+NMCS enables coexistence.
+
+**Layer 1 – Monetary Interface**
+
+- Legal compliance
+- Taxation
+- External exchange
+
+**Layer 2 – Graph Settlement (CAN)**
+
+- Contribution weighting
+- Trust propagation
+- Access rebalancing
+
+Money handles compliance.
+
+NMCS handles coordination.
+
+Over time, monetary settlement becomes peripheral in domains where graph settlement proves more efficient.
+
+Transition is evolutionary — not abrupt.
+
+---
+
+## 10. Applied Illustration: Platform Mediation vs Graph Settlement
+
+Consider the ecosystem of Google, which has distributed over USD 100 billion to creators via advertising revenue-sharing systems.
+
+The structural topology:
+
+- A → Z (Creators provide informational value for free)
+- Z → Y (Users provide attention to advertisers)
+- Y → B (Advertisers pay platform)
+- B → A (Platform redistributes revenue)
+
+Where:
+
+- A = Content creators
+- Z = Users
+- Y = Advertisers
+- B = Platform infrastructure
+
+Creators provide knowledge to users for free. Users do not pay creators directly.
+
+Monetisation occurs indirectly through advertising markets. The platform becomes central clearing authority.
+
+The true value path (A → Z) is non-monetary; settlement is displaced to advertising exchange.
+
+Under NMCS:
+
+- A → Z contribution would be directly recognised
+- Z engagement would reinforce contribution weights
+- Infrastructure contribution by B would be separately weighted
+- Revenue (in hybrid phase) would be treated as external input
+
+The graph computes enablement across degrees without requiring a central redistribution monopoly.

+
+---
+
+## 12. Structural Implications
+
+This architecture enables:
+
+- Coordination without price as primary allocator
+- Trust without central authority
+- Settlement without tokens
+- Explicit recognition of multi-degree enablement
+- Gradual transition from monetary mediation to direct value handling
+
+Where money asks:
+
+“Who paid whom?”
+
+CAN asks:
+
+“Who enabled what — across how many degrees — and how should access adjust accordingly?”
+
+---
+
+## 13. Conclusion
+
+WP-005 formalises the transition from ledger coordination to graph coordination.
+
+By embedding six-degree propagation, need discovery, and NMCS into the core of CAN, this architecture:
+
+- Preserves large-scale operability
+- Reduces extraction pressure
+- Enables hybrid transition
+- Gradually renders monetary settlement structurally optional
+
+This is not abolition by decree.
+
+It is replacement by functional superiority.
+
+Graph settlement replaces exchange settlement. Direct value handling replaces price mediation.
+
+The coordination layer evolves.

+# Contribution–Access Network (CAN)
+## WP-006: Operationalising Graph Settlement — Simulation, Governance Stress Testing, and Deployment Framework
+
+**Working Paper WP-006**  
+**Status:** Technical & Deployment Specification  
+**Version:** 1.0  
+**Date:** 2026  
+
+---
+
+## Abstract
+
+WP-005 formalised the Six-Degree Network Ledger Architecture and Non-Monetary Complex Settlement (NMCS) as the structural evolution of CAN.
+
+WP-006 operationalises that architecture by specifying:
+
+- Computational implementation of graph settlement
+- Weight decay and trust propagation models
+- Simulation framework for multi-hop coordination
+- Adversarial stress testing mechanisms
+- Governance cell deployment model
+- Phased real-world rollout strategy
+
+Where WP-005 established theory and structure, WP-006 establishes execution.
+
+---
+
+## 1. Objective
+
+To demonstrate that:
+
+1. Graph settlement is computationally feasible at scale
+2. Trust propagation can be stabilised across large networks
+3. NMCS remains robust under adversarial conditions
+4. Hybrid transition can occur without institutional shock
+
+---
+
+## 2. Computational Model
+
+### 2.1 Graph Definition
+
+Let:
+
+**G(t) = (N, E, W(t))**
+
+Where:
+
+- N = participants
+- E = verified enablement edges
+- W(t) = time-dependent weight matrix
+
+Each edge e(i, j) may carry:
+
+- contribution weight (c)
+- reliability modifier (r)
+- validation multiplier (v)
+- decay factor over degree distance (d^k)
+
+Total propagated contribution is computed without tokens and without transferability.
+
+### 2.2 Degree Decay
+
+Impact decays over network distance to prevent permanent dominance and infinite accumulation.
+
+Example options:
+
+- exponential: d^k = e^(−λk)
+- linear capped: d^k = max(0, 1 − αk)
+- adaptive: adjust decay using path redundancy
+
+---
+
+## 3. Trust Computation
+
+Trust(A → Z) is computed as an aggregate of validated paths weighted by:
+
+- path length (degree distance)
+- reliability persistence
+- governance validation
+- redundancy (multi-path confirmation)
+
+Clique/collusion risks are mitigated via:
+
+- path diversity requirements
+- reinforcement caps
+- anomaly detection
+- random audits
+
+---
+
+## 4. Access Allocation Engine
+
+Access priority is computed per resource pool as a vector:
+
+P(n, pool) = w1(C_direct) + w2(C_propagated) + w3(Trust) + w4(Reliability) + w5(Need) − w6(Overconcentration)
+
+Weights are pool-specific and governance-controlled.
+
+---
+
+## 5. Simulation Framework
+
+### 5.1 Baseline Network Simulation
+
+Test:
+
+- 10^3–10^6 nodes
+- varying participation rates
+- varying validation strictness
+- adversarial injection rates
+
+Measure:
+
+- allocation variance and fairness
+- concentration drift
+- trust collapse thresholds
+- recovery time after shocks
+
+### 5.2 Platform Topology Simulation (Creator → User → Advertiser → Platform)
+
+Model:
+
+- A → Z (free informational provision)
+- Z → Y (attention)
+- Y → B (revenue)
+
+Replace central redistribution logic with NMCS propagation.
+
+Measure:
+
+- creator stability
+- dependency reduction on central payout
+- resilience under demand shocks
+
+### 5.3 Free-Rider Stress Test
+
+Inject passive actors and observe:
+
+- trust decay
+- tier pressure (access reduction without punitive deprivation)
+- system stability under 5/10/20% passive rates
+
+---
+
+## 6. Governance Cell Deployment
+
+Cells manage:
+
+- local validation
+- edge verification
+- appeals and disputes
+- parameter tuning per pool
+
+Safeguards:
+
+- rotation and term limits
+- cross-cell arbitration
+- transparent audit trails
+
+---
+
+## 7. Hybrid Deployment Strategy
+
+Phased rollout:
+
+1. institutional pilots (bounded domains)
+2. multi-pool integration (cross-domain graph)
+3. monetary shrinkage (price mediation reduces where graph settlement performs)
+
+Money remains a compliance interface where required.
+
+---
+
+## 8. Adversarial Models
+
+Stress tests include:
+
+- trust ring inflation
+- contribution spam
+- governance capture attempts
+
+Mitigation relies on:
+
+- diversity requirements
+- auditability
+- anomaly detection
+- contestability and arbitration
+
+---
+
+## 9. Outcomes and Metrics
+
+Define measurable indicators:
+
+- concentration coefficient
+- trust dispersion index
+- allocation fairness variance
+- retention rate of contributors
+- shock recovery time
+
+These metrics serve as empirical validation criteria for CAN deployments.
+
+---
+
+## 10. Conclusion
+
+WP-005 defined the architecture.
+
+WP-006 defines operationalisation.
+
+Graph settlement is simulation-ready, governance-testable, and deployable in hybrid environments without requiring abrupt abolition of monetary systems.
