+# Contribution–Access Network (CAN)
+## WP-002: A Practical Post-Money System for Allocating Resources
+
+**Working Paper WP-002**
+**Status:** Practical Design Draft
+**Version:** 1.1
+**Date:** 2026
+
+---
+
+## Abstract
+
+This paper specifies a realistic model for allocating resources without money
+in large-scale, low-trust environments.
+
+It is not utopian and not moralistic.
+
+It is designed for real humans, including predictable human factors such as
+emotion, laziness, ego, fear, burnout, and opportunism.
+
+CAN replaces monetary purchase with a structured allocation rule based on
+verified contribution, reliability, and care context.
+
+---
+
+## 1. Core Principle
+
+**Access is earned through contribution, not bought with tokens.**
+
+CAN does **not** use:
+
+- Money inside the allocation layer
+- Universal tradeable credits
+- Accumulation by abstract purchasing power
+
+CAN does use:
+
+- Verified useful activity
+- Reliability over time
+- Human-need correction mechanisms
+
+This principle already appears in partial form on platforms such as GitHub,
+Stack Overflow, Wikipedia, open-source ecosystems, and status-based access
+systems.
+
+---
+
+## 2. Three Ledgers (Not One)
+
+Money collapses many value types into one number.
+
+CAN separates allocation inputs into three ledgers.
+
+### A. Contribution Ledger (What You Give)
+
+Tracks useful outputs and inputs, including:
+
+- Work and maintenance
+- Care labour
+- Teaching and mentoring
+- Creativity and problem-solving
+
+Validation uses peer confirmation plus observed downstream usage.
+
+### B. Reliability Ledger (Can You Be Trusted?)
+
+Tracks whether commitments are executed:
+
+- Showing up
+- Completing tasks
+- Consistency over time
+- Abuse or non-delivery patterns
+
+This ledger supports planning and system-level predictability.
+
+### C. Care Ledger (Human Need)
+
+Tracks constraints and vulnerability that should adjust allocation:
+
+- Illness
+- Burnout
+- Parenting and care load
+- Age and crisis events
+
+Purpose: prevent punishment for ordinary human life conditions.
+
+---
+
+## 3. Resource Pools (Not Markets)
+
+Resources are organized into governed commons pools, for example:
+
+- Housing
+- Food
+- Energy
+- Transport
+- Learning access
+- Tools and workspaces
+
+Users request access; they do not bid.
+
+Allocation uses transparent weighting:
+
+**Contribution + Reliability + Care → Access Priority**
+
+Governance is local-first with digital coordination.
+
+---
+
+## 4. Operational Examples
+
+### Housing
+
+High contribution + high reliability + elevated family/health stress ⇒ higher
+priority.
+
+Outcome: fewer bidding wars and lower extraction pressure.
+
+### Transport
+
+Strong usage record ⇒ fast access.
+
+Repeated misuse ⇒ restricted access.
+
+Outcome: car-sharing style accountability at infrastructure scale.
+
+### Food
+
+Core baseline is guaranteed.
+
+Additional options can be contribution-weighted.
+
+Outcome: no starvation floor and no unlimited hoarding ceiling.
+
+---
+
+## 5. Motivation Without Money
+
+CAN assumes humans are motivated by more than cash:
+
+- Status
+- Belonging
+- Purpose
+- Recognition
+- Autonomy
+
+The system makes these motivations visible and institutionally meaningful.
+
+Social capital becomes actionable coordination capital.
+
+---
+
+## 6. Free-Riding, Laziness, and Participation Tiers
+
+CAN assumes some people will try to minimize contribution.
+
+It responds through tiered access (not punitive deprivation):
+
+- **Core** → survival guarantees
+- **Active** → stable comfort access
+- **Builder** → expanded privileges
+- **Steward** → governance influence
+
+No starvation punishment.
+
+No premium access for permanent free-riding.
+
+Pressure is primarily social and structural rather than carceral.
+
+---
+
+## 7. Corruption and Capture Prevention
+
+CAN includes explicit anti-capture safeguards:
+
+- Decentralized governance cells
+- Transparent, auditable records
+- Rotating roles and term limits
+- AI-assisted anomaly and collusion detection
+- Community veto and contestability pathways
+
+Design target: no durable elite lock-in.
+
+---
+
+## 8. Technical Feasibility
+
+CAN requires no speculative breakthrough.
+
+Necessary components already exist:
+
+- Identity systems
+- Distributed ledgers / append-only logs
+- Reputation and trust scoring systems
+- AI verification and auditing assistance
+- Local governance applications
+
+Current deployments are mainly finance-first; CAN repurposes these capabilities
+for resource coordination.
+
+---
+
+## 9. Transition Path (No Sudden Switch)
+
+CAN is designed for phased transition:
+
+1. **Parallel Layer** — deploy in bounded pilots alongside money
+2. **Pool Expansion** — add domains and participants
+3. **Monetary Shrinkage** — reduce price mediation where CAN performs reliably
+4. **Post-Money Majority** — money remains peripheral in many domains
+
+Goal: transition without collapse dynamics and without revolutionary rupture.
+
+---
+
+## 10. Why It Works Psychologically
+
+CAN maps common human frictions to explicit design responses:
+
+- Laziness → tiered access boundaries
+- Ego → visible status and contribution profiles
+- Fear → guaranteed basics
+- Greed → no universal accumulation vector
+- Burnout → care-ledger protection
+
+CAN is designed for flawed humans, not idealized actors.
+
+---
+
+## 11. Where It Already Exists (Partially)
+
+CAN-like logic already appears in:
+
+- Open-source communities
+- Guild structures
+- Cooperatives
+- Mutual aid networks
+- Community trusts
+
+CAN integrates these fragments into shared public infrastructure.
+
+---
+
+## Strategic Insight
+
+Money coordinates by proxy.
+
+CAN coordinates by direct value recognition.
+
+**Action → Impact → Access**
+
+Post-money is not “no system.”
+
+It is better trust and coordination infrastructure for networked societies.
